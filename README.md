## Description

This is a MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) application that searches Google Books for a given book title, then displays the results. It has a user login function that then provides a method to save desired book titles from the search results to the logged in user's account. The internal database API functions are provided through a GraphQL API using Apollo Server. 
## Installation

- In the client directory in package.json open integrated terminal and npm i.
- Now start your server in the root directory package.json with npm start.
- Once server is running in the client directory package.json start your app with npm start.
